100 years ago , there was a Bitmaker Labs for farmer .
They teach how to cultivate farms.
On their farm they had pumpkins, and apples and little bitmakers.
These bitmakers were the most rare of their produce. They held the key to the future of Bitmaker farms. 
Now we are studying how to code not cultivate.
